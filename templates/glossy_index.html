  <h2>About</h2>
  <p class="index-info">Glossy started in 2010 with the intent of making languages available to those people interested in communicating in them.</p>
  <p class="index-info">We noticed that many languages are documented by academics, but that these are hardly widely available, and rarely to those people hoping to use them in the field.</p>
  <p class="index-info">Richard Littauer is a student of linguistics, knows his way around endangered and low-population languages, and wants to flex his coding muscle. Simon Vansintjan is a coder and designer who knows his way around websites and mobile applications, and wants to flex his linguistic muscle. </p>
  <p class="index-info">They have made their work freely available to anyone, but are poor students, so it'd be great if you could donate.</p>
